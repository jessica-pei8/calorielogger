## Project Summary

The app we are building is called Logger. Logger is an app that tracks fitness goals of an individual given their schedule, behaviors, workout data, and soft biometric traits. We will be using two datasets: health and sleep statistics, and calories burned during activity. Logger, more specifically, aims to provide the user a personalized calorie tracker not only when they exercise, but throughout every event in their schedule. This differs from the typical fitness tracker, as other fitness apps ignore passive calorie burn through intermediary activities such as sleep, walking to work, or even passively fidgeting while stationary. 


Logger will be created with the average working American in mind. Our app solution will make it easy for the user to slot in their schedules and start tracking calorie loss right away. We aim to create an intuitive interface that integrates smoothly with users' routines and provides actionable insights through data visualization. Logger will leverage modern technologies such as machine learning to analyze and predict user behavior, further enhancing the accuracy of its tracking and personalization features. With this holistic approach, we hope to set Logger apart from conventional fitness apps by offering a more nuanced understanding of calorie tracking and overall health management.
